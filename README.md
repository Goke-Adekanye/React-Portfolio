Getting started with Glassmorphism.

Glassmorphism is a unified name for the popular Frosted Glass aesthetic. It has many names depending on the company using it, the effect is based on background blur with transparency, and uses stacked layers to show the depth and context of the interface.

This project combines the use of glassmorphisn, create-react-app, and material-UI to achieve a beautiful and fully responsive cross browser user-interface.
